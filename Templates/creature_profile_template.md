**Template Purpose:** This template is designed for creating detailed creature profiles for ChatGPT-assisted D&D sessions. Use this template for monsters, beasts, and other non-sentient or primarily combat-focused entities that serve as encounters, obstacles, or environmental elements.

**When to Use This Template:**
- Monsters and beasts (dragons, owlbears, goblins in combat roles)
- Creatures with limited or no social interaction beyond combat
- Environmental threats or obstacles
- Creatures where tactical/combat behavior is the primary focus

**When to Use NPC Template Instead:**
- Named characters with significant dialogue or social interaction
- Creatures that serve narrative functions beyond combat
- Characters with complex motivations, relationships, or story arcs
- Any entity that players will have extended conversations with

**Note:** Campaign material takes precedence over all other sources. Use core books and expanded materials only to supplement details not specified in your campaign.

# Template Selection Guide

## Creature Profile Template Usage

This template focuses on entities where **combat capability, environmental presence, and tactical behavior** are the primary concerns. Creatures created with this template are designed to:

- Provide engaging combat encounters
- Serve as environmental obstacles or threats  
- Represent the fauna and monsters of your world
- Function as tactical challenges rather than social ones

## Key Distinctions from NPC Template

### Use Creature Template When:
- The entity's primary role is combat or environmental challenge
- Social interaction is minimal or non-existent
- Personality traits are simple or combat-focused
- The creature follows instinctual or simple behavioral patterns
- Players interact with it primarily through combat or skill challenges

### Use NPC Template When:
- The entity has complex social motivations
- Extended dialogue or negotiation is expected
- The character has personal relationships and story arcs
- Players will interact through conversation, persuasion, or social mechanics
- The character needs depth for Foundry VTT's Intelligent NPCs module

### Overlap Cases:
Some intelligent creatures (like dragons, devils, or tribal leaders) may warrant either template depending on their campaign role:
- **Creature Template**: If serving primarily as a boss fight or tactical encounter
- **NPC Template**: If serving as a negotiation partner, quest giver, or recurring character
