# D&D Campaign Management Toolkit

My personal collection of frameworks, prompts, and templates for running D&D 5e campaigns with AI assistance.

## What's Here

This repository contains three main components I've developed for organizing and running my campaigns:

### NodeStructure/
**Campaign organization framework**
- `Field_Guide.md` - Complete documentation of my RANS (Roleplay Adventure Node System) approach
- `Technical_Reference.md` - Implementation details and technical notes

The RANS system organizes campaign content into modular "nodes" with two key dimensions:
- **Narrative Priority** (Critical/Mission/Optional/Informational)  
- **Schema Depth** (Lite/Standard profiles)

### Prompts/
**AI prompt engineering for session management**
- `DMPrompt.md` - Main prompt for ChatGPT/AI interaction during sessions
- `DM_Framework.md` - Framework for maintaining narrative consistency
- `Enhanced_Skill_Challenge_Prompt_For_ChatGPT.md` - Specialized challenge generation
- `InsertGenerator.md` - PDF Inserts generator for my PDFs that I use with ChatGPT or similar while preparing my material or running sessions
- `Prep_Commands_and_Tools.md` - Command reference for session prep

These prompts handle bilingual gameplay (English/Portuguese), character integration, and dynamic NPC/creature behavior during sessions.

### Templates/
**Structured content generation**
- `NPC_Profile_Template.md` - Comprehensive NPC creation template
- `creature_profile_template.md` - Template for creature behaviors and tactics

Templates work with the AI prompts to generate consistent, detailed NPCs and creatures that integrate with campaign nodes.

## How I Use This

1. **Planning**: Use RANS to organize campaign content into nodes
2. **Preparation**: Load relevant prompts into ChatGPT before sessions
3. **Runtime**: Use AI commands during play for dynamic NPC interactions
4. **Content Creation**: Generate NPCs/creatures using templates as needed

## Current Status

This is my active working system - I'm constantly refining the prompts and framework based on actual play experience. The approaches here work for my table, but your mileage may vary.

## Campaign Context

Currently optimized for:
- Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk and custom content
- Bilingual gameplay (English/Portuguese)
- AI-assisted session management
- Node-based campaign organization
