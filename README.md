# D&D Campaign Management Toolkit

My personal collection of frameworks, prompts, and templates for running D&D 5e campaigns with AI assistance.

*Note: These tools assume familiarity with D&D campaign management and AI prompt usage.*

## What's Here

### NodeStructure/
**Campaign organization framework**
- `Field_Guide.md` - Complete documentation of my RANS (Roleplay Adventure Node System) approach
- `Technical_Reference.md` - Implementation details and technical notes (WIP and not usable)

The RANS system organizes campaign content into modular "nodes" with two key dimensions:
- **Narrative Priority** (Critical/Mission/Optional/Informational)  
- **Schema Depth** (Lite/Standard profiles)

### Prompts/
**AI prompt engineering for session management**
- `DMPrompt.md` - Streamlined prompt for ChatGPT/AI interaction during sessions
- `DM_Framework.md` - Advanced framework with command system and cultural guidelines
- `Enhanced_Skill_Challenge_Prompt_For_ChatGPT.md` - Specialized challenge generation
- `InsertGenerator.md` - PDF content generator for campaign preparation
- `Prep_Commands_and_Tools.md` - Command reference for session prep

### Templates/
**Structured character/creature creation with clear selection guidance**
- `NPC_Profile_Template.md` - Comprehensive NPC creation with dual ChatGPT/Foundry VTT integration
- `Creature_Profile_Template.md` - Combat-focused creature profiles for tactical encounters

Both templates include detailed selection guidance to help choose the right template for different campaign entities.

## System Integration

This toolkit integrates **ChatGPT** for AI-assisted session management with **Foundry VTT** for virtual tabletop execution:

- **ChatGPT**: Dynamic NPC dialogue, encounter generation, and real-time campaign assistance
- **Foundry VTT**: Uses the Intelligent NPCs module for persistent NPC behavior and memory
- **RANS Framework**: Modular content organization that works seamlessly with both platforms

## How I Use This

1. **Planning**: Use RANS to organize campaign content into structured nodes with priority levels
2. **Preparation**: Load DM Framework into ChatGPT, then use specialized prompts for specific prep tasks
3. **NPC Creation**: Use templates to generate comprehensive profiles that work in both ChatGPT and Foundry VTT
4. **Runtime**: Use streamlined DMPrompt for dynamic interactions while Foundry handles VTT mechanics
5. **Content Management**: Leverage the dual-system approach for persistent campaign continuity

## Current Status

This is my active working system. I'm constantly refining based on actual play experience. 

Currently optimized for Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk with custom content.
