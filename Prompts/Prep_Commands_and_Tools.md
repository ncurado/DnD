# Integration Plan for Prep Commands and Tools (Updated)

This plan focuses on enhancing the existing DM Framework by integrating a streamlined **Prep Commands and Tools** section. It ensures all additions complement existing workflows without introducing unnecessary complexity.

## **Goals**
1. Refine the DM Framework's preparation workflows by introducing tools specifically tailored to pre-session tasks.
2. Avoid redundancy by ensuring new commands extend the functionality of existing ones.
3. Provide concise and actionable tools for tasks like NPC alignment, encounter testing, and narrative enrichment.

### **Command: /encounter_optimizer** (Refined)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive encounter analysis for balance, narrative depth, and engagement.

**Syntax**:
```plaintext

- **--tactics**: Proposes monster strategies.
- **--dynamic**: Includes environmental modifiers.
- **--auto**: Automatically calculates standard values if inputs are incomplete.

**Enhanced Features**:

2. **Contextual Prompts**: Tailors follow-up questions based on the details provided.
3. **Time-Saving Defaults**: The **--auto** flag assumes standard values (Level 3, 4 players, CR based on average challenge).

1. **Simple Encounter**:
   ```plaintext
   /encounter_optimizer Bandits CR2 Party: 4 Players, Level 3 --balance
   ```
   **Output**:
   - Balance: Moderate challenge.
   - Suggestion: Add light terrain hazards (e.g., narrow footpaths reducing movement).

   ```plaintext
   /encounter_optimizer Kobolds Cave --narrative --dynamic
   ```
   **Output**:
   - Narrative Hook: The kobolds are defending a dragon egg.
   - Environmental Features: Collapsing tunnels create obstacles (Dexterity DC 12).
   - Dynamic Modifier: Magical crystals pulse, increasing kobold attack rolls by +1 in the dark.

3. **Missing Details**:

   /encounter_optimizer Undead Crypt
   ```
   **Response**:
   ```plaintext
   Missing Details:  
   - Party level and size.  
   - CR of Undead.  

   Would you like to proceed with assumed values for a Level 3 party of 4 players? (Y/N)
   ```

## **New Commands**

### **Command: /dynamic_environment**
**Purpose:** Generate environmental challenges based on locale and ongoing story arcs.
- **Example Use:**
  ```

---

## **Integration Notes**
1. **Streamline Workflow:** These commands should be positioned as **extensions of existing flows**, ensuring prep tasks remain focused and efficient.
2. **Avoid Redundancy:** Commands like `/align_npc` and `/test_scenario` are essential refinements rather than duplications.
3. **Focus on Prep Only:** Ensure these tools are clearly marked for pre-session use, reducing cognitive load during live gameplay.

## Usage Instructions
- Copy these commands into your DM Framework’s **Preparation Workflow** section.
- Test each command in a session prep scenario to validate its usefulness and ensure it complements your DM style.
