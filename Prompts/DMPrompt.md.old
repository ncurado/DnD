Purpose: Use this command to deepen player immersion by ensuring NPC actions or motivations align with or challenge player arcs dynamically.

Example Usage:
/align_npc
NPC: Nyxara, Cult Alchemist
Player: Silvius

Example Output:
Alignment Results for Nyxara:
	•	Connection: Nyxara manipulates Silvius by hinting at his draconic lineage, offering him power at a cost.
	•	Conflict Potential: High. Nyxara’s goals clash with Silvius’s chaotic good alignment.
	•	Engagement Opportunity: Nyxara creates a moral dilemma, demanding Silvius perform a task that risks alienating his party.

How to Use /align_npc Effectively:
	1.	Before Gameplay: Use /align_npc during prep to test and refine NPC motivations, conflicts, and connections to player arcs.

Example: /set_language PT → Switches narration to Portuguese:
"O caminho através da floresta é sombrio, com sombras dançando à luz fraca do luar."

/toggle_language
Function: Cycles through available language options (EN → PT → DUAL).

# Bring Characters to Life: NPCs and Creatures

Context:

The players are encountering one or more NPCs and/or creatures in a [hostile/non-hostile] scenario. Profiles for all NPCs and creatures already exist, detailing their personalities, motivations, behaviors, relationships, and combat tactics. Descriptions, dialogue, and actions must follow the DM Framework, including Translation Guidelines and structured interaction rules.

Task:

Bring [one/multiple NPCs or creatures] to life during this encounter. Use their profiles to guide their dialogue, actions, reactions, and group dynamics. Incorporate sensory descriptions, speech patterns, emotional tone, and personality or behavioral quirks for immersion.

- **Validation**: Use `/test_scenario` to ensure all responses adhere to the DM Framework before integrating them into gameplay. This ensures NPCs, creatures, and descriptions remain consistent and immersive.

Detailed Requirements and Rules

1. Behavior, Dialogue, and Dynamic Interaction

	•	For NPCs:
	•	Reflect personality traits, motivations, and relationships from their profiles.
	•	Use culturally or personality-driven speech patterns (e.g., formal, sarcastic, gruff) to enhance individuality.
	•	Adapt dialogue to players’ behavior (e.g., respectful, hostile, or indifferent).
	•	Provide at least three possible responses for interactions based on player approaches:
	•	Example: If players attempt intimidation, the NPC may respond with fear, anger, or resistance based on their profile.
	•	Indicate emotional or instinctual shifts (e.g., nervousness when pressured, curiosity when players reveal valuable information).
	•	For Creatures:
	•	Use intelligence, instincts, and environmental context to guide actions and reactions.
	•	Add thematic behavioral cues (e.g., territorial roars, curious tilts of the head, stalking behavior).
	•	Suggest instinctual responses to players’ presence (e.g., fleeing if overwhelmed, becoming defensive when cornered).

2. Dynamic Interaction

	•	Responses to Player Actions:
	•	Detail how NPCs or creatures respond to player tone, behavior, or tactics.
	•	Example: “The goblin hesitates as the rogue brandishes a dagger, then sneers, ‘Not so scary when yer outnumbered, eh?’”
	•	Emotional or Instinctual Shifts:
	•	Indicate changes in mood or instincts based on the players’ actions.
	•	Example: “The merchant flinches as the barbarian slams a fist on the table, muttering, ‘Alright, alright! I’ll talk!’”
	•	Sharing or Withholding Information:
	•	Suggest how NPCs or creatures may share or withhold information based on the players’ approach (e.g., persuasion, deception, intimidation).
	•	Example: “The bandit leader smirks, ‘You want answers? You’ll have to earn them.’”
	•	Use the /clarify Command:
	•	Prompt for clarification if it’s unclear whether the description applies to a single player or the entire group.

3. Scene Setting

	•	Sensory Details:
	•	Incorporate vivid sights, sounds, smells, and textures to create a rich atmosphere.
	•	Example: “The room is dimly lit, the smell of damp stone mingling with the tang of rusted iron. A faint dripping echoes in the distance.”
	•	Environmental Interactions:
	•	Highlight how NPCs or creatures use the environment.
	•	Example: “The goblin darts behind a stalagmite, peeking out just long enough to hurl a rock at the fighter.”

4. Action Hooks (Optional)

	•	For Hostile Groups:
	•	Describe combat readiness, group tactics, or taunts.
	•	Example: “The hobgoblin captain sneers, ‘You’ll regret stepping into our camp!’ as the archers notch arrows in unison.”
	•	For Non-Hostile Groups:
	•	Suggest ways to deepen interaction, such as offering quests, alliances, or hints.
	•	Example: “The innkeeper sighs, ‘If you’re really here to help, maybe you can deal with those blasted wolves near the mill.’”

5. Translation Guidelines

	•	Adherence to DM Framework:
		•	Ensure names, mechanics, and in-language terms remain untranslated (e.g., “Fireball,” “Estalagem Stonehill”).
		•	Maintain pre-1990 Orthographic Agreement standards for European Portuguese.
		•	Avoid “você,” favoring “tu,” “vós,” or neutral structures.
		•	Provide sensory descriptions and dialogue in dual language if /set_language DUAL is active.
	•	When using Portuguese:
		•	Retain key terms in English (creature names, spells, abilities, mechanics).
		•	Default to pre-1990 European Portuguese orthography for all translations.
		•	Ensure no Brazilian Portuguese grammar or vocabulary is used.

## Scenario Validation with `/test_scenario`

- Use `/test_scenario` to run a non-persistent simulation for testing NPC dialogue, creature behavior, or sensory descriptions.
- Ideal for ensuring:
  - NPCs remain in character (dialogue reflects motivations and personality).
  - Creatures behave in line with intelligence, instincts, or tactical behavior.
  - Descriptions meet sensory and tone requirements from the DM Framework.
- Scenarios simulated with `/test_scenario` do not alter the memory or saved context of the campaign.

Expanded Workflow Example

Scenario:
The players encounter a band of goblins in a forest clearing. The goblins are wary but not immediately hostile. One goblin, a gruff leader named Grokk, has been detailed in the campaign profile.

Step-by-Step Interaction

	1.	Scene Setting:
“The forest clearing is bathed in dappled sunlight, but the shadows seem alive as four goblins step out from the underbrush. The smell of damp earth mixes with the faint tang of sweat and unwashed bodies. One of them mutters something in Goblin, ‘Vraz guk!’ as they approach.”
	2.	Group Dynamics:
“Grokk snarls at the others, ‘Stay sharp, idiots! No more guthik mistakes!’ One goblin hisses under its breath, ‘Nok garuk,’ only to earn a sharp glare from Grokk.”
	3.	Behavior and Dialogue:
	•	If players try to intimidate:
Grokk sneers, “Big words for someone outnumbered. Let’s see if your bite matches your bark, zhughar!”
	•	If players try to negotiate:
Grokk crosses his arms, “You want safe passage? Ha! What’s in it for us, guk guk?”
	4.	Dynamic Interaction:
	•	If the fighter takes an aggressive stance:
“The goblins tense, hands tightening on their weapons, but Grokk chuckles darkly, ‘You’ve got guts. Shame they’ll end up on my spear, gukruk!’”
	•	If the bard plays a soothing tune:
“The goblins exchange uncertain glances, one muttering in Goblin, ‘What is this?’ Grokk raises a hand. ‘Hold up. What’s this about, guklik?’”
	5.	Action Hook (Optional):
“Grokk spits on the ground, ‘Fine. We’ll let you pass if you deal with those blasted wolves to the north. They’re bad for business. Zigguk!’”
	6.	Translation (if /set_language PT):
“Grokk cospe no chão, ‘Certo. Deixamos vocês passarem se lidarem com aqueles lobos ao norte. Eles são ruins para os negócios. Zigguk!’”

### Workflow Example: Testing an Encounter

**Command**: `/test_scenario`
**Context**: Players are entering a tense negotiation with Grokk, a goblin leader, and his agitated underlings.

**System Response**:
- Simulated Scene: "Grokk sneers at the players, his yellowed teeth showing as he crosses his arms. 'Safe passage? What's in it for me?'"
- Feedback:
  ✅ Dialogue matches Grokk’s cunning and self-serving traits.
  ✅ Descriptions provide adequate sensory immersion (e.g., 'yellowed teeth showing').
  ⚠️ Suggest softening tone if players offer a bribe to reflect Grokk’s greed.

**Result**: No memory saved; feedback provided for refinement.

Full Example for Inclusion in the DM Framework

You should include this example in the Translation Guidelines Section or, if you have a dedicated section for Workflow Examples, it could also fit there. Here’s the finalized version of the example, formatted for easy inclusion:

Example: Translating a Hostile Encounter with Dual-Language Output

Scenario:
The players encounter Redbrand ruffians outside the Sleeping Giant in Phandalin. The objective is to validate descriptions, group dynamics, and dialogue while adhering to translation rules from the DM Framework.

English Output:
The air is heavy with the smell of stale ale and damp wood as the players approach the dimly lit exterior of the Sleeping Giant. Shadows shift near the entrance, revealing a group of Redbrand ruffians lounging against the wall. Their leather armor is scuffed, and each carries a weapon with the casual menace of someone used to getting their way. One of them spits on the ground as the players draw closer.

Portuguese Output:
O ar está carregado com o cheiro de cerveja velha e madeira húmida enquanto os jogadores se aproximam do exterior mal iluminado da Sleeping Giant. Sombras se movem perto da entrada, revelando um grupo de bandidos Redbrand encostados na parede. Suas armaduras de couro estão gastas, e cada um carrega uma arma com a casualidade ameaçadora de alguém acostumado a impor sua vontade. Um deles cospe no chão enquanto os jogadores se aproximam.

Key Guidelines Demonstrated

	1.	Proper Noun Handling:
	•	Names such as Sleeping Giant and Redbrand remain untranslated, preserving their narrative identity.
	2.	Orthographic Compliance:
	•	Uses “húmida” instead of “úmida”, adhering to pre-1990 European Portuguese orthography.
	3.	Framework Adherence:
	•	Descriptions maintain sensory immersion (e.g., “smell of stale ale” / “cheiro de cerveja velha”).
	•	Translation reflects formal, neutral tone in Portuguese, avoiding informal structures (e.g., no “você”).

Example Scenario: Orc Encounter

Context:

The players are ambushed by a group of orcs on a narrow mountain pass. The orcs, led by a scarred veteran named Grulmak, aim to seize the party’s supplies for their warband. The encounter challenges the players to respond to threats, negotiate, or fight.

Scene Setting:

English:
The rocky mountain pass is narrow, the cliffs on either side towering high above. The sharp wind carries the faint smell of blood and sweat. A sudden roar breaks the stillness as a group of orcs appears from behind jagged boulders. Their leader, a hulking brute with a jagged scar across his face, bellows, “Weaklings! Drop your supplies and run, or face Grulmak’s wrath!”

Portuguese:
O estreito desfiladeiro montanhoso é cercado por penhascos altos de ambos os lados. O vento cortante carrega o cheiro de sangue e suor. Um rugido repentino quebra o silêncio quando um grupo de orcs aparece por trás de rochas irregulares. Seu líder, um brutamontes com uma cicatriz serrilhada no rosto, berra: “Fracos! Larguem seus suprimentos e corram, ou enfrentem a fúria de Grulmak!”

Group Dynamics:

	1.	Leader’s Actions:
English:
Grulmak strides forward, raising his massive greataxe high. “This path belongs to the warband! Leave now, or I’ll paint these rocks red with your blood! Lokar dar ur!”
Portuguese:
Grulmak avança, levantando seu enorme machado de guerra. “Este caminho pertence à nossa horda! Saiam agora, ou eu pinto estas pedras de vermelho com o sangue de vocês! Lokar dar ur!”
	2.	Supporting Orcs:
English:
The two orcs flanking him snarl, gripping their weapons. One beats his chest and shouts, “Grulmak speaks! Obey, or die!” while the other pounds the haft of his spear on the ground, snarling, “For Lokar! Nok guk!”
Portuguese:
Os dois orcs ao seu lado rosnaram, segurando suas armas. Um bate no peito e grita: “Grulmak fala! Obedeçam ou morram!” enquanto o outro bate o cabo de sua lança no chão, rosnando: “Por Lokar! Nok guk!”

Behavior and Dialogue:

	•	If Players Intimidate:
English:
Grulmak growls, his scar twisting as he sneers. “You think you scare me? I’ve killed bigger cowards than you! Lok-thar!”
Portuguese:
Grulmak rosnou, sua cicatriz se retorcendo enquanto ele zombava. “Acham que me assustam? Já matei covardes maiores que vocês! Lok-thar!”
	•	If Players Try to Negotiate:
English:
Grulmak narrows his eyes. “What could you offer Grulmak that’s worth your lives? Speak quickly, or I’ll let my blade decide!”
Portuguese:
Grulmak estreita os olhos. “O que poderiam oferecer a Grulmak que valha suas vidas? Falem rápido, ou deixarei minha lâmina decidir!”
	•	If Players Attack:
English:
Grulmak roars, “Warband, kill them all! No mercy! Dughar ur!” The orcs charge forward, weapons raised and their war cries echoing through the pass.
Portuguese:
Grulmak rugiu: “Horda, matem todos! Sem piedade! Dughar ur!” Os orcs avançam, armas erguidas, enquanto seus gritos de guerra ecoam pelo desfiladeiro.

Key Features in This Example:

	1.	Proper Noun Handling:
	•	Names like Grulmak and Lokar remain untranslated, preserving immersion and narrative identity.
	2.	Cultural Depth:
	•	Orc-specific war cries (“Lokar dar ur” for victory, “Nok guk” for commands) highlight their warlike and brutal culture.
	3.	Behavioral Consistency:
	•	Orc leaders are commanding and pragmatic, while subordinates show loyalty and aggression.
	4.	Translation Rules:
	•	Dialogue follows pre-1990 orthographic conventions (“pinto estas pedras”).
