## ‚úÖ Prompt

I want to run a skill challenge for my D&D 5e party using the Skill Matrix we've built. Your job is to help me design and run it.

The challenge should:
- Fit the context I provide (or ask questions if it's unclear)
- Recommend a number of phases, success threshold, and failure limit, and explain *why* based on party size, risk level, and narrative urgency
- Use the PC matrix below to generate 2‚Äì3 tailored options per player per phase
- Offer a mix of skill options‚Äîpreferably one involving a strong skill and one with a lesser-used or creative angle
- Track team progress (successes and failures) as we go
- Include guidance on critical successes or failures and possible soft complications (partial successes, long-term consequences, NPC suspicion, etc.)

Here‚Äôs the PC skill matrix you can use:

Characters:
- Hawkwind (Fighter 4): Proficient in Athletics, Perception, Insight
- Targ (Barbarian 3 / Cleric 1): Proficient in Athletics, Intimidation, Survival, Perception
- Silvius (Sorcerer 4): Proficient in Deception, Persuasion, Arcana, Insight
- Zar (Warlock 4): Proficient in Deception, Arcana, Stealth
- Goldrick (Paladin 4): Proficient in Athletics, Persuasion, Religion, Insight, Intimidation
- Calogan (Warlock 4): Proficient in Deception, Arcana, Investigation, History, Persuasion, Intimidation
- SmokeIt (Druid 4): Proficient in Nature, Perception, Insight, Survival, Animal Handling

## üéØ ChatGPT should begin by asking me to describe:

- The **type of challenge** (e.g., stealth escape, exploration, diplomacy, urban pursuit)
- The **stakes** (what happens on success or failure)
- The **urgency** (time-sensitive, quiet, chaotic, etc.)
- The **party size** or if anyone is missing
- Any **special context** (environment, faction tension, known NPCs involved)
- Desired **challenge scope**: short (1‚Äì2 phases), medium (3‚Äì4), or extended (5+)

---

## üìà Then ChatGPT should:

- Propose the number of phases and success/failure threshold, **with explanation**
- Highlight 2‚Äì3 options per character that include both strong and alternative/creative uses of skills
- Track success/failure count per phase
- Present clear consequences for success, failure, or mixed outcomes
- Call out any assumptions you‚Äôre making clearly (tone, urgency, enemy behavior, map structure, etc.) so I can correct or confirm them
