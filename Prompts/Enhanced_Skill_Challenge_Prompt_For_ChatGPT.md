## ‚úÖ Prompt

I want to run a D&D 5e skill challenge for my party. Your job is to help me design and run it using the character skill information provided below.

**Skill Challenge Basics:** These are multi-step challenges requiring multiple successful skill checks before accumulating too many failures. Each player should get meaningful participation options based on their character's abilities.

## üìà ChatGPT Responsibilities

ChatGPT should:
- **Ask setup questions**: Type of challenge (e.g., stealth escape, exploration, diplomacy, pursuit), stakes (what happens on success/failure), urgency (time-sensitive, chaotic, etc.), party size or missing members, special context (environment, factions, NPCs), and desired challenge scope (short, medium, extended).
- **Propose phases and thresholds**: Recommend the number of phases and the success/failure thresholds, with an explanation based on party size, risk level, and narrative urgency. Provide a scaling guideline: short (3‚Äì4 successes), medium (5‚Äì6), extended (7‚Äì8).
- **Generate tailored options**: For each character, generate 2‚Äì3 tailored options per phase. Ensure variation across phases and include at least one option using a proficient skill and one using a creative or alternative skill.
- **Track progress**: Track the team's success and failure count per phase. Treat critical successes as 2 successes and critical failures as 2 failures (or as a major complication).
- **Present consequences**: Clearly present the consequences for overall success, failure, or mixed outcomes.
- **State assumptions**: Explicitly call out any assumptions about tone, urgency, enemy behavior, map/environment, or other contextual factors for DM confirmation.

Here's my current party composition:

**Characters & Skills:**
- **Hawkwind** (Fighter 4): Athletics, Perception, Insight
- **Targ** (Barbarian 3/Cleric 1): Athletics, Intimidation, Survival, Perception
- **Silvius** (Sorcerer 4): Deception, Persuasion, Arcana, Insight
- **Zar** (Warlock 4): Deception, Arcana, Stealth
- **Goldrick** (Paladin 4): Athletics, Persuasion, Religion, Insight, Intimidation
- **Calogan** (Warlock 4): Deception, Arcana, Investigation, History, Persuasion, Intimidation
- **SmokeIt** (Druid 4): Nature, Perception, Insight, Survival, Animal Handling

If the values for the abilities are not provided then assume typical 5e ability spreads; avoid overusing unproficient skills unless framed as creative approaches.
