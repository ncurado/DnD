## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Analyze the Book’s Content

* Estimate the **% of readable and usable content**.
* Flag any **major issues** such as:

  * Scanning errors
  * Missing pages
  * Layout or OCR noise
* If usability appears problematic (significant OCR errors, missing content, poor formatting), include a short **Optional Note** recommending text-layer cleanup or OCR.

### 2. Insert Page Metadata

Include the following fields:

* **Insert Page Header**:
  `Insert Page v1.0 – [Date] – [Book Title]`

* **Title** (max 10 words):
  A concise name that reflects the book’s primary subject.

* **Tags** (choose 2–4 most relevant):
  * **Content Type**: `#MAGIC`, `#LORE`, `#TACTICS`, `#MONSTERS`, `#WORLDBUILDING`, `#RPGRULES`
  * **System**: `#5E`, `#PF2`, `#OSR`, `#SYSTEMAGNOSTIC`
  * **Usage**: `#REFERENCE`, `#ADVENTURE`, `#SUPPLEMENT`

Multiple tags from the same category are acceptable if the content justifies it.

* **Summary** (3–4 sentences):
  Describe what the book covers, how it’s structured, and what kind of support it offers for a GM. Focus on scope, structure, and GM utility; avoid marketing tone.

* **Optional Note** (if needed):
  E.g., “Some OCR errors present but overall readable.” or “PDF would benefit from reprocessing for text-layer clarity.”

### 3. Quick-Reference Guide

**Provide**:

* **Major Sections/Chapters**
  List them with 1–2 sentence summaries describing the content focus.

* **Highlights**
  Bullet out the most impactful mechanics, lore, or systems a GM would need at the table.

* **Keywords**
  List 5–10 key terms that summarize the book’s content and improve retrievability.

### 4. Finalization Step

After presenting the draft Insert Page and Quick-Reference, ask:

> “Do you want to make revisions to this draft before finalizing it?”

* If **NO**: Present the final, structured version ready for insertion or copy-paste.  
* If **YES**: Wait for user feedback and then revise.

## 📄 Insert Filename Convention (Standard)

> Use this structure for insert file naming:

```
insert_[bookname]_v[version].pdf
```

* `[bookname]`: Clean, lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `play-unsafe`, `dungeon-design`)
* `[version]`: Insert version number (e.g., `1.0`, `1.1`)

Example: `insert_play-unsafe_v1.0.pdf`, `insert_dungeon-design_v1.0.pdf`

**Prioritize structure, clarity, and searchability. Avoid filler. Use clean formatting and consistent tagging.**
